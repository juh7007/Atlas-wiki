## Exploring Cohort Summary Statistics

### Problem
You have defined and generated a cohort within Atlas and would like to know the distribution of age, gender, race and ethnicity.

### Solution

 1. On the *Cohort Definitions* page select a previously defined and generated cohort. This will direct you to the cohort definition editor.

 1. Select the *Analysis Status* tab, click the checkbox beside the analysis type _Person_, and click the **Generate** button. A job is triggered in the background which runs the analysis.

 1. After the job completes, on the *Cohort Reporting* page choose the same cohort you chose in Step 1. In the report dropdown select _Person_. From the source dropdown select _Source_. Click the **View Report** button.

### Discussion
This recipe demonstrated how to visualize basic demographic statistics of a generated cohort. There are a number of other reports available that allow you to visualize the other categories of statistics (e.g. conditions, procedures, drug exposures) of a generated cohort.
